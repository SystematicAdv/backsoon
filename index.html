        <p>We are currently undergoing massive updates and different implementations we will be adding to our extension "Roblox Daily Rewards" within the next 7 days, stay tuned! Huge shoutout to Microsoft Edge for allowing us to republish our extension after an issue was found within the source code, we are actively working on getting the updated new version pushed out! Microsoft Edge is an amazing web store to use, because when they take you down, you can get right back up after you remove the issue they mentioned. Thank you Edge for not being like Chrome, and thank you to all of our supporters. We will be back soon!</p>
